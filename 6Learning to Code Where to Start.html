<h1>Learning to Code. Where to start?</h1>

<p>This is one of the biggest questions I had when I started to learn to code, what language should I start with etcâ€¦. I see this question a lot and answers vary from person to person, so this is going to be my attempt at answering the question. </p>

<p>I started to learn to code when I was about 15 years old which is quite late compared with people I see on Twitter, the main reason for this is because I livid in Spain for 6 years from the age of 11 and spent most of my time on a quad bike instead of a computer. At the age of 15 I took a real interest in computers and decided I wanted to learn to code, then I was hit by the question of where to start. I searched Google a bit and stupidly decided to start with Visual Basic (wow that was hard to admit) the main reason I chose to learn Visual Basic first was that I found some tutorials on the MSDN website that were very complete, I didn&#39;t stay learning VB for very long after doing a bit more research i found that it wasn&#39;t rated very highly.</p>

<p>What I have learn&#39;t since has been the most valuable to me and I wish to share. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really matter where you start, start with whatever language you like although I will suggest a few at the end. What you need to learn is not the code but the concepts and terminology behind the code.</p>

<h4>Concepts != code</h4>

<p>This is translated from something my Java lecturer said to the class on my very first day at University. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what language you want to write an if statement in as long as you know that you need a conditional structure you can Google it or ask someone&quot;.</p>

<p>I have learn&#39;t this lesson well, since getting to University I have had to learn Java, C and x86 assembler but what I really know is the concept and terminology behind what I want to do in each language and thus am able to ask the right questions or look in the right places within the documentation of the language I am trying to write.</p>

<p>Most places where you can learn to code online nowadays teach concepts of code through the language they are teaching so don&#39;t be afraid to get stuck in and just write code, once you start you will pick up the terminology and be able to write in whatever language you want and with practice become confident within that language. </p>

<p>I have decided that I am going to only suggest one site where you should learn to code as I believe that the way they teach is very useful for new coders.</p>
