<h1>Welcome to my new Blog</h1>

<p>So I have decided to create another blog as my last attempt didn&#39;t go to well, I wrote about 3 posts. Hopefully this attempt will be a bit better. </p>

<h3>What will I be blogging about?</h3>

<p>I have decided that the blog is going to be based on stuff I learn that I think will be useful. Most will probably be code related, or have a relation to Computer Science. I may also write about personal projects/hacks I am working on (Who knows?).</p>

<h3>A bit about me</h3>

<p>I am a 19 year old student, studying Computer Science at the University of the West of England.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like writing about myself so thats all you are getting.</p>

<p>If you want to chat I am on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/harveytoro" title="@harveytoro">@harveytoro</a></p>

<h3>This blog</h3>

<p>This blog is a github repository so all previous posts will be in the repository, I will get around to stating this in the footer (what footer?), when I get around to adding the footer.</p>
