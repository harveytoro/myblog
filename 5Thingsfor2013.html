<h1>13 Things for 2013</h1>

<p>This being my last blog post for 2012, I would first like to wish all of my readers and followers from twitter a very Happy New Year. The title of this post is 13 things for 2013, I am going to write down 13 things that I would like to accomplish for 2013. This past year has been one hell of a roller coaster there have been a lot of ups and quite a few downs but as today is the 31st I think I can say that I am pleased with the overall result of 2012.</p>

<p>Lets get cracking.</p>

<p>1)   Build an IOS app. This is probably one of those things that I have wanted to do for a while and haven&#39;t had the time or the equipment, as 2012 saw me get a MacBook pro I now have the equipment to build an IOS app and it is up to me to find the time. I have a few good app ideas or hacks that I would like to give a go.</p>

<p>2) Meet more people (be a bit more sociable). Yes I am the first to admit that I need to be a bit more sociable, so I am going to make an effort in 2013 to meet new people and talk instead of coding all the time. Don&#39;t get me wrong this is going to be very difficult for me as I don&#39;t find starting conversation with people very easy. </p>

<p>3) Make friends with a graphic designer, as a programmer designing is the last thing I want to do, I would love to be good at it but I am not and I don&#39;t need to be, what needs to be great is my code and by finding someone who can worry about the design aspect of it helps me spend more time on the code thus meaning I need to get to know a graphic designer so that all of my late night hacks don&#39;t look so bad. After all I am going to Uni where there should be graphic design students so here I need to go back to stage 2 and meet some of those students.</p>

<p>4) Write better code. Yep thats right in 2013 I would like to write better code. Although I love to hack code quickly, some of the code that I write could do with a few comments, I have days where I will spend the whole day hacking code then not touch that code for a week or two and when I get back to it I have to spend 10 minutes understanding what I wrote because I didn&#39;t put comments, This is mostly when using an API which I then have to go back to the documentation and read that again, whereas if I had written better code in the first place I would have a comment explaining the part of the API I was using.</p>

<p>5) Help people interested in code learn. The internet has given a lot to me while I have been learning to code and continue to learn, I want to give a bit back by helping others learn to code or helping others with bugs that I may have already experienced and worked out. Partly this is why I started this blog and I would like to continue writing articles that help. I would also like to become more active on sites like Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>6) Build a service that people can use. I have been working on one that I originally built for myself and currently only I am using but I would like to find time to finish it and let others see it, maybe even have an IOS app for it which would kill to birds with one stone as the saying goes.</p>

<p>7) Be healthier. Im a student and a programmer these things don&#39;t go to well together not only do I eat a lot of fast foods and stuff like that I drink a hell of a lot of coke and Red Bull (Partly because I am still celebrating Stratos). Time to be a bit more healthier I think.</p>

<p>8) Get a summer Internship. As I am now studying Computer Science at University I need a internship for the summer of 2013 within this field. If you want to help me with that drop me an email harveytoro @ HoTmAiL (dot)CoM.</p>

<p>9) Relax more. I spend a lot of time writing code and when I am not writing code I am thinking I should be to help me continue learning and becoming the best I can be, the side effect to this is that I find it very hard to relax.</p>

<p>10) Explore. I am going to just get in my car and drive, I will probably start by searching the town that I live in (Bristol) and then who knows where.</p>

<p>11) Plan a skiing trip for the end of the year or beginning of 2014. I had a brilliant time when I went in Feb and wanted to go again in January but due to other commitments I can&#39;t so I definitely want to go when I next get the opportunity.</p>

<p>12) Learn from experiences of 2012.</p>

<p>13) Spend time with my family and appreciate everything that my parents do for me and have done for me. I try to this every year but its important to keep it up.</p>

<p>Thats it folks there are the 13 things that I plan to do in 2013. I will review them at the end of the Year.</p>

<h1>Lets hack the future. See you all in 2013.</h1>
