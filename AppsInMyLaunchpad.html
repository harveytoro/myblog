<h1>Apps in my Launchpad</h1>

<p>I have about 10 apps that I use all the time, since getting my macbook I have only installed about 20 apps which saves cluttering it up with stuff I would only use about once. So in this blog post I am going to name the 10 apps that I work with on a day to day bases.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" title="Sublime text 2">Sublime Text 2</a></h3>

<p>Sublime text 2 is a clean uncluttered code editor, what makes it so good is that it just lets you code, but in the background it has powerful features. By installing packages you can increase the features.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="http://krillapps.com/coderunner/" title="CodeRunner">CodeRunner</a></h3>

<p>Whether you are learning a new language or want to write and run an algorithm quickly CodeRunner is the app to use, it allows you to run code on a inbuilt console in multiple different languages.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" title="Filezilla">FileZilla</a></h3>

<p>Is a powerful FTP client, if you have to use FTP then I suggest you use FileZilla. Alternatively I suggest you push your files to a private repo and use a service like FTPLOY to FTP it to your host.</p>

<h3>4. <a href="http://mac.github.com/" title="GitHub">GitHub</a></h3>

<p>Probably a good time to mention the Github app which I use to push code to Github. (obviously)</p>

<h3>5. <a href="http://www.markdownpro.com/" title="Markdown Pro">Markdown Pro</a></h3>

<p>Markdown pro is a brilliant markdown editor which I am currently using to write this blog post and use to write all of my university notes. You can export to HTML or PDF, and lets face it markdown is pretty cool you don&#39;t have to use a clunky word processor, just write markdown in fact everybody should be using it.</p>

<p><code>Wow this writing a blog post thing is tiring don&#39;t be surprised if I don&#39;t get to 10 apps</code></p>

<h3>6. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="Eclipse">Eclipse</a></h3>

<p>Used to write Java code for my uni course work.</p>

<h3>7. <a href="http://netbeans.org/" title="NetBeans">NetBeans</a></h3>

<p>Also used to write Java code for my uni course work. I would normally only use one or the other but we use Netbeans in uni but I prefer Eclipse so I have both.</p>

<h3>8. <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/" title="Netlogo">Netlogo</a></h3>

<p>For Ai Uni work. I have to say that I don&#39;t really like the Netlogo language but it is what it is.</p>

<h3>9. <a href="http://getpocket.com/apps/desktop/" title="Pocket">Pocket</a></h3>

<p>We all know what pocket does, so will save my typing.</p>

<h3>10. <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" title="Chrome">Google Chrome</a></h3>

<p>I have tried most web browsers and I did get on well with safari, until I started using the &#39;Inspect Element&#39; feature so I changed back to chrome.</p>
