<h1>MathematicsX</h1>

<p>So I have set up a repository on <a href="https://github.com/harveytoro/MathematicsX" title="on Github">Github</a> where I will be putting code related to maths, I normally write this code to get answers to problems in my Principles Of Computing module. </p>

<h3>Any language</h3>

<p>Thats right the code in the repository will be in any language. Due to the fact that I like to learn how to do things in new languages I am not going to keep to a set language. The three main languages will probably be PHP, C and Java.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Basically because I don&#39;t really like maths that much but I need to know how to do this stuff or at least be able to write code that can do it for me.</p>

<h3>Want to help?</h3>

<p>If you want to write some code to go in the repository, go ahead and write In whatever language you like.</p>
